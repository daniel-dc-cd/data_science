    "So, we see that **age**, **restbp**, **chol** and **thalach** are all `float64`, which is good, because we want them to be floating point numbers. All of the other columns, however, need to be inspected to make sure they only contain reasonable values, and some of them need to change. This is because, while **scikit learn Decision Trees** natively support continuous data, like resting blood preasure (**restbp**) and maximum heart rate (**thalach**), they do not natively support categorical data, like chest pain (**cp**), which contains 4 different categories. Thus, in order to use categorical data with **scikit learn Decision Trees**, we have to use a trick that converts a column of categorical data into multiple columns of binary values. This trick is called **One-Hot Encoding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you may be wondering, \"what's wrong with treating categorical data like continuous data?\" To answer that question, let's look at an example: For the **cp** (chest pain) column, we have 4 options:\n",
    "1. typical angina,\n",
    "2. atypical angina,\n",
    "3. non-anginal pain,\n",
    "4. asymptomatic\n",
    "\n",
    "If we treated these values, 1, 2, 3 and 4, like continuous data, then we would assume that 4, which means \"asymptomatic\", is more similar to 3, which means \"non-anginal pain\", than it is to 1 or 2, which are other types of chest pain. Thus, the decision tree would be more likely to cluster the patients with 4s and 3s together than the patients with 4s and 1s together. In contrast, if we treat these numbers like categorical data, then we treat each one a separate category that is no more or less similar to any of the other categories. Thus, the likelihood of clustering patients with 4s with 3s is the same as clustering 4s with 1s, and that approach is more reasonable.\n",

    "**NOTE:** There are many different ways to do **One-Hot Encoding** in Python. Two of the more popular methods are `ColumnTransformer()` (from **scikit-learn**) and `get_dummies()` (from **pandas**), and the both methods have pros and cons. `ColumnTransformer()` has a very cool feature where it creates a persistent function that can validate data that you get in the future. For example, if you build your **Decision Tree** using a categorical variable **favorite color** that has **red**, **blue** and **green** options, then `ColumnTransformer()` can remember those options and later on when your **Decision Tree** is being used in a production system, if someone says their favorite color is **orange**, then `ColumnTransformer()` can throw an error or handle the situation in some other nice way. The downside of `ColumnTransformer()` is that it turns your data into an array and looses all of the column names, making it harder to verify that your usage of `ColumnTransformer()` worked as you intended it to. In contrast, `get_dummies()` leaves your data in a dataframe and retains the column names, making it much easier to verify that it worked as intended. However, it does not have the persistent behavior that `ColumnTransformer()` has. So, for the sake of learning how **One-Hot Encoding** works, I prefer to use `get_dummies()`. However, once you are comfortable with **One-Hot Encoding**, I encourage you to investigate using `ColumnTransformer()`.\n",
