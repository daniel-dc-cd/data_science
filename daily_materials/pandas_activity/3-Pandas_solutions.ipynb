        "Having explored NumPy, it is time to get to know the other workhorse of data science in Python: pandas. The pandas library in Python really does a lot to make working with data--and importing, cleaning, and organizing it--so much easier that it is hard to imagine doing data science in Python without it.\n",

        "But it was not always this way. Wes McKinney developed the library out of necessity in 2008 while at AQR Capital Management in order to have a better tool for dealing with data analysis. The library has since taken off as an open-source software project that has become a mature and integral part of the data science ecosystem. (In fact, some examples in this section will be drawn from McKinney's book, *Python for Data Analysis*.)\n",

Ironically, while panel data is a usable data structure in pandas, it is not generally used today and we will not examine it in this course. Instead, we will focus on the two most widely used data structures in pandas: `Series` and `DataFrame`s."
