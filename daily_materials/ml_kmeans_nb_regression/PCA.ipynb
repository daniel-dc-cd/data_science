Thus the number of observations (data points) needed to account for these configurations must also increase. This fact of life has huge ramifications for the time, computational effort, and memory required. As a result, it is often desirable to reduce the number of dimensions we work with.\n\nThe challenge is determining which features we can remove from our analysis.\n\nNot all features are created equal. Certain features may impede our analysis, or simply not be overly important. We need to identify the features to exclude, but obviously we can only take this so far. At a certain point reducing dimensions will also reduce the accuracy of a classifier and our analysis.\n\n## Our scenario\n\nWe have a collection of foods and their nutrients. We'd like to group them together so we can see similar items. Our traditional categorization of dairy or vegetables aren't descriptive enouth, and can be a little misleading. For example, not all fruits are created equal - an avocado is rather different from a apple. We'd like to group our foods together based on their composition.\n\nAs we begin our analysis, our initial challenge is trying to determine what makes a food item a food item? What components are most important? It's a real struggle to try to determine what components we should focus on."

      "source": "## PCA in theory\n\nOne way to reduce the number of dimensions we have to work with is by projecting (or converting) our feature space into a lower dimensional space. The reason why we can do this is that in most real-world problems, data points are not spread uniformly across all dimensions. Some features might be near constant, while others are highly correlated, which means that those data points lie close to a lower-dimensional subspace.\n\n\n### An analogy\n\nWe can picture the process of PCA reducing the number of dimensions as we would, well, a picture. A picture is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional world. But the reason a pixel sits where it does on a picture and looks how it looks is because of where it is on the X, Y and Z coordinates which make up the world we see. The picture isn't merely taking a two-dimensional slice, but rather consolidating three dimensions into two **new** dimensions.\n\nThis is especially evident in a picture with a [bokeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh) effect (those pictures where the subject is in focus and everything else is blurry). The photographer has exerted a fair bit of control over how the conversion from 3-D to 2-D is going to take place. The pixels making up our subject will show as sharp, while all other pixels will be fuzzy. Basically, the photographer is drawing our eyes to what's important.\n\nWe can do the same with the dimensions (or columns) in our data, reducing the number and allowing us to focus (pun intended) on the important information.\n\n## PCA in action\n\nPCA behaves much in the same way, by allowing us to focus on what's important, specifically variance. Where are we seeing a spread of data? Where are we seeing change? What's truly impacting the data?\n\nLet's take a look at an example of a three dimensional data space as represented in the image below. The data points are not spread across the entire plane, but are nicely clumped, roughly in an oval. Because the cluster (or, indeed, any cluster) is roughly elliptical, it can be mathematically described by two values: its major (long) axis and its minor (short) axis. These axes form the *principal components* of the cluster. Basically, this is where the magic is happening for our data.\n\n<img align=\"center\" style=\"padding-right:10px;\" src=\"Images/PCA.png\">\n\nWe can **construct a whole new feature space** around this cluster, defined by two *eigenvectors* (the vectors that define the linear transformation to this new feature space), $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$. Better still, we don't have to consider all of the dimensions of this new space. Intuitively, we can see that most of the points lie on or close to the line that runs through $c_{1}$. So, if we project the cluster down from two dimensions to that single dimension, we capture most of the information about this data sense while simplifying our analysis. This ability to extract most of the information from a dataset by considering only a fraction of its definitive eigenvectors forms the heart of principal component analysis (PCA).\n\n## Import modules and dataset\n\nYou will need to clean and prepare the data in order to conduct PCA on it, so pandas will be essential. You will also need NumPy, a bit of Scikit Learn, and pyplot."

We can apply a different technique - centering the data around 0; that is, we will again transform the data, this time so that every column has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Put another way, we're going to standardize our data around 0. Scikit-learn has a convenient function for this - [StandardScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html).

PCA provides meaningful dimensions which are non-correlated, so our cluster will typically provide better results. This is why we started with PCA to before we attempted to cluster our foods together.\n\nTo perform the categorization, we're going to use [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering). In a nutshell, k-means will look to identify groups (or clusters) in our data.\n\nWe're going to start by loading the library, creating our model, and then fitting our PCA results into the model. We are arbitrarily using 3 clusters; in [Machine Learning 2](https://github.com/microsoft/Reactors/tree/main/Machine_Learning_2) there is a deeper conversation of k-means and how to determine the best number of clusters. We're using just the first 5 components as we determined it will provide the best return on investment."

PCA's main goal is to provide us with a better signal to noise ratio. It helps us weed out the dimensions which aren't as important, and provide more meaningful insights into the relationships between our data. It's commonly used before categorization algorithms, such as k-means."
