# Welcome to the Saudi Digital Academy Artificial Intelligence Workshop!

I'm glad you're here!

## What to expect

This will be a one-day session where you'll explore Artificial Intelligence (AI) and [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/), how to integrate AI into your applications, when to create your own Machine Learning (ML) models, all by walking through a set of examples built on [Python](https://python.org).

## Prerequisites

The course does assume you are familiar with a programming language, such as Java, Ruby, or C#. We will be using Python, but no Python experience is required. We chose Python because it's an extremely popular language, especially in this space, and it's one whose syntax is relatively readable. We have provided a [primer on Python](./intro-python.md) and [Flask](./intro-flask.md) (which we use for the website you'll be creating) to help get you started.

We make no assumptions about your level of knowledge when it comes to AI or ML. This course is built assuming you're curious about this emerging technology, but haven't necessarily experienced it first hand. Or maybe you're already using similar services on another cloud provider and want to explore Microsoft's offerings.

## Setup

If you wish to follow along, there's a few steps you'll need to complete to configure your system. We've got a full [setup guide](./setup.md) for you to use!
